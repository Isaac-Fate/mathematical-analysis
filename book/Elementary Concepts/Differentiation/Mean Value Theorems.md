# Mean Value Theorems

````{prf:theorem} Extension of Generalized Mean Value Theorem
:label: thm:44

Let $f$ and $g$ be two functions on $(a, b)$, each having a derivative (**finite** or **infinite**) at each point in $(a, b)$. Suppose that $f(a+)$, $f(b-)$, $g(a+)$ and $g(b-)$ all exist as **finite values**. Suppose further that there is no point $x \in(a, b)$ such that
$f^\prime(x) = g^\prime(x) = \infty$. Then, there exists some point $c \in(a, b)$ such that 

```{math}
\begin{align*}
f^\prime(c)(g(b-) - g(a+))
= g^\prime(c)(f(b-) - f(a+))
\end{align*}
```
