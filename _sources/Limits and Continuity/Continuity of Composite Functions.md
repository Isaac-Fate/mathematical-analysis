# Continuity of Composite Functions

````{prf:theorem}
:label: thm:41

Let $(X, d_X)$, $(Y, d_Y)$ and $(Z, d_Z)$ be metric spaces. Let $f: X \to Y$ and $g: f(X) \to Z$ be functions. If $f$ is continuous at point $p \in X$ and $g$ is continuous at $f(p)$, then the composite function $f \circ g$ is continuous at $p$.
