# Computing Limits

The basic rules of computing limits are listed in the next theorem.


````{prf:theorem}
Let  $f$  and  $g$  be complex-valued functions defined on a subset  $S$  of a metric space  $(X,d)$ . Let  $p$  be an accumulation point of  $S$ , and suppose that the following limits exist:

```{math}
\begin{align*}
\lim _ {x \to p}  f(x) = a
\quad \text{and} \quad \lim _ {x \to p}  g(x) = b
\end{align*}
```

We have

- (1) $\lim_{x \to p}[f(x) \pm g(x)] = a \pm b$ ,
- (2) $\lim_{x \to p}f(x) g(x) = a b$ ,
- (3) $\lim_{x \to p} f(x) / g(x) = a / b$  provided that  $b \neq 0$ .
