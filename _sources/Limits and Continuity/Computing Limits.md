# Computing Limits

The basic rules of computing limits are listed in the next theorem.


````{prf:theorem}

Let $f$ and $g$ be complex-valued functions defined on a subset $S$ of a metric space $(X,d)$. Let $p$ be an accumulation point of $S$, and suppose that the following limits exist:

```{math}
\begin{align*}\lim_{x \to p} f(x) = a
\quad\text{and}\quad\lim_{x \to p} g(x) = b
\end{align*}
```

We have
- ➀ $\lim_{x \to p}[f(x) \pm g(x)] = a \pm b$,
- ➁ $\lim_{x \to p}f(x) g(x) = a b$,
- ➂ $\lim_{x \to p} f(x) / g(x) = a / b$ provided that $b \neq 0$.
