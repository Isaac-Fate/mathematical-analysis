Characterization of Functions of Bounded Variation
Let  $f$  be a real-valued function on  $[a, b]$ . Then, the following statements are equivalent.

1. $f$  is of bounded variation on  $[a, b]$ .
2. There exist two increasing functions  $g$  and  $h$  on  $[a, b]$  such that  $f = g - h$ .
3. There exist two  **strictly**  increasing functions  $g$  and  $h$  on  $[a, b]$  such that  $f = g - h$ .
