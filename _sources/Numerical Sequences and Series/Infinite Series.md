# Infinite Series

The next theorem tells us that we can add two convergent series term by term. And we can also multiply a convergent series by a constant.


````{prf:theorem}
:label: thm:48
If  $\sum a_n$  and  $\sum b_n$  are two convergent series, then the series  $\sum (\alpha a_n + \beta b_n)$  also converges where  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  are constants. Furthermore, we have

```{math}
\begin{align*}
\sum _ {n=1} ^ \infty ( \alpha  a_n +  \beta  b_n)
=  \alpha \sum _ {n=1} ^ \infty  a_n
+  \beta \sum _ {n=1} ^ \infty  b_n
\end{align*}
```
