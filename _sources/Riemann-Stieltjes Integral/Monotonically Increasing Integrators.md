# Monotonically Increasing Integrators


It is much easier to study and prove some properties of the Riemann-Stieltjes integrals if we require that $\alpha$ is monotonically increasing.



Thanks to {prf:ref}`thm:22`, which states that every function of bounded variation can express as a difference of two increasing functions, almost all the properties introduced in this section can be extended with ease to integrators of bounded variation.
